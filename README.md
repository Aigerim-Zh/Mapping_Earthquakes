# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between teh magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

I am tasked with using the URL for GeoJson earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then I will add the data to a map.


The earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. See all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and data on a third map.

```JavaScript``` and ```D3.js``` library to retrieve coordinates and magnitudes from the GeoJSON data.
```Leaflet``` library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactvity for the earthquake data.

# Deliverable 1. Add Tectonic Plate Data

# Deliverable 2. Add Major Earthquake Data

# Deliverable 3. Add an Additional Map


Create interactive maps

with JavaScript in D3 library

GeoJSON data is the industry standard representative geographic features such as 

* Points which contain addresses and locations, like latitude and longitude coordinates
* Linestrings, which contain coordinates for the boundaries of streets, highways, travel routes, and tectonic plates
* Polygons, which contain coordinates for the boundaries of zip codes, counties, countries, providences, and tracks of land


Non-Spatial Attributes such as 
* Elevation
* Temperature
* Rain accumumilation
* Hail size
* Tornado/hurricane strength
* Magnitude of an earthquake

D3 and Leaflet libraries

Build an interactive visualization of earthquakes around the world

and plot the dat on the mapbox

On the map, the magnitude and location will be shown on a pop-up marker. 

The marker size and color reflect the magnitude of an earthquake. Earthquakes with larger magnitudes will appear with darker and larger markers.
